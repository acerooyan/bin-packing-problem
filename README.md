# bin-packing-problem
The project involves testing various bin packing algorithms experimentally to determine the quality of the solutions they produce. The specific bin-packing algorithms you should implement are the following five algorithms (please see the course notes for details on these algorithms):

Next Fit (NF)
First Fit (FF)
Best Fit (BF)
First Fit Decreasing (FFD)
Best Fit Decreasing (BFD)
